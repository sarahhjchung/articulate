## Development

### Project Structure

#### Tech Stack

The client uses the following architecture and technologies to develop the web application:

- [React TypeScript](https://react.dev/learn/typescript) as the development library and language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development bundling
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for static error prevention (outside of types)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing our components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for components

### Components

We use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) collection to build our UI. Shadcn is a collection of re-usable components where you can install whatever component you need, and customize them to fit your theme. There's no need for any dependency installation. See the [documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) to learn more about shadcn and how to use their components.

To learn more about our UI components and pages, see the docstrings in the component `.tsx` files.

### Usage

Ensure that you have followed the [Development Requirements](https://github.com/csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m/blob/main/README.md#development-requirements) to set up your local environment before running the client. To start the client:

```bash
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Testing

We have basic unit tests for most of the composite components. You can find them in the `/components/{Component}/tests` folder under the specific components. The tests check for components existing, correct labeling of variables, and strings matching the expected constants. In the future, we hope to be expanding on these unit tests and adding integration tests to test for more complex behaviours.

Ensure that you have followed the [Development Requirements](https://github.com/csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m/blob/main/README.md#development-requirements) to set up your local environment before testing. To run the unit tests:

```bash
cd client

# Running pnpm run test will ask you to install jsdom. Install and re-run the tests
pnpm run test
```
